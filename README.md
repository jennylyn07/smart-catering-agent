# 🍽️ Smart Catering Agent
### AI-Powered Multi-Agent Pipeline for Intelligent Catering Operations
**Code Without Barriers Hackathon 2026 — ASEAN Edition**  
Problem Statement 1 — iNextLabs  
Participant: Jennylyn Magno | Solo | Philippines

---

## The Problem

Catering businesses manage complex, interconnected workflows — customer intake, menu planning, cost control, logistics, and inventory — often handled manually or across disconnected tools. The result: 30% food waste from poor planning, budget overruns from inconsistent pricing, delivery delays from logistics gaps, and miscommunication that compounds at every step.

A traditional app reacts after things go wrong. A multi-agent system prevents problems before they happen — each specialist focused on one job, all collaborating in real time.

---

## The Solution

Smart Catering Agent is a multi-agent AI system where five specialized agents operate as a coordinated pipeline to produce a complete, optimized catering plan from a single customer request — with no manual intervention required between agents.

> *"The Head Chef proposes Beef Kaldereta. The Accountant flags it as a cost driver. They negotiate. The Head Chef reformulates. The Logistics Lead calculates staffing. The Stock Manager plans procurement. All automatically."*

## The Five Agents

### 🧑‍💼 Agent 1 — The Concierge
**Role:** Customer intake and intent parsing

Receives raw customer text and extracts a fully validated 
event specification. Distinguishes hard dietary constraints 
(applied to entire menu) from soft preferences (noted for 
consideration). Applies deterministic code fallbacks for all 
required fields. Prompt injection protected.

**Technology:** GPT-4o (temp 0.0) · Pydantic validation · 
Hard constraint enforcement in code

---

### 👨‍🍳 Agent 2 — The Head Chef
**Role:** Menu design and recipe selection

Queries the RAG knowledge base for cuisine-appropriate 
candidates, then uses GPT-4o to select dishes that balance 
variety, dietary compliance, and occasion appropriateness. 
Applies Menu Engineering quadrant thinking 
(Stars/Plow Horses/Puzzles/Dogs). During budget negotiation, 
follows a reformulation priority order: Protein Down-Tiering 
→ Portion Re-balancing → Service Style adjustment → Dish 
removal as last resort only.

**Technology:** GPT-4o (temp 0.8) · Azure AI Search RAG ·
68 individual recipe documents · Post-AI allergy safety check ·
Hardcoded `NUTRITION_LOOKUP` (68 dishes) → per-serving kcal/protein/carbs/fat on every `MenuItem`

---

### 💰 Agent 3 — The Accountant
**Role:** Cost calculation and budget compliance

Calculates ingredient costs from RAG pricing data, applies
a 7% industry-standard cost buffer, adds fixed labor and
overhead. When over budget, uses pre-computed variance
analysis before calling GPT-4o to reason about which dishes
to flag — minimum flagging, reformulation before removal.
Negotiates with Head Chef up to 3 rounds. Outputs a
**recommended selling price** (total cost ÷ 0.70) and
**estimated profit margin (30% target)** for profitability
forecasting alongside the budget compliance report.

**Technology:** GPT-4o (temp 0.0) · RAG pricing ·
Deterministic math in code · GPT reasoning for soft
judgment only · Profitability margin calculation in code

---

### 🚚 Agent 4 — The Logistics Lead
**Role:** Timeline planning and staffing calculation

Interprets event notes using GPT-4o with industry staffing
ratios (plated 1:10-12, buffet 1:20-25, full bar 1:35) and
T-minus Critical Path Method. Calculates exact staff numbers
for each specific event. Derives a **Gantt chart**
(`gantt_chart: List[GanttTask]`) directly from the CPM
timeline, providing machine-readable start/end/duration
segments for each preparation milestone.

**Technology:** GPT-4o (temp 0.3) · Deterministic backward
time calculation · Industry ratios in prompt · Gantt
derivation in code (`_derive_gantt()`)

---

### 📦 Agent 5 — The Stock Manager
**Role:** Inventory check and procurement planning

Checks inventory levels against mock warehouse data,
generates procurement lists, identifies waste risk items
using FIFO/yield reasoning, and explains supplier selection
rationale. Both GPT calls run concurrently via
asyncio.gather() with 8s timeout and graceful degradation.
**Runs in parallel with the Logistics Lead** — both agents
receive the cost report and execute simultaneously via
`asyncio.gather()` in the orchestration engine, reducing
total pipeline latency.

Note: Inventory data is loaded from Azure Cosmos DB first
(container: catering-inventory). If Cosmos inventory is
unavailable or empty, the agent falls back to a local mock
inventory file (data/mock_inventory.json).

**Technology:** GPT-4o · asyncio.gather() concurrent calls ·
Deterministic math for quantities · Parallel orchestration
with Logistics Lead

---

## Architecture Principle

> **Hard constraints live in code, always. Soft judgments 
> belong to GPT. Math belongs to code. Every GPT call 
> degrades gracefully.**

- Dietary restrictions and allergies: enforced in code 
  after every AI call
- Budget status: accurately reported, never manipulated 
  by AI
- Cost calculation: deterministic math, never delegated 
  to GPT
- Staffing numbers: calculated by code from GPT-interpreted 
  service style
- All GPT calls: graceful fallback to deterministic results 
  on any failure

This aligns directly with iNextLabs Key Success Factor: 
*"Rules-based logic guides decisions with AI insights; 
agents act within established guardrails."*

---

## Agent Communication Protocol

Every agent-to-agent message follows the structured 
JSON protocol:

```json
{
  "header": {
    "message_id": "uuid-...",
    "agent_id": "head_chef",
    "target_agent": "accountant",
    "timestamp": "2026-05-01T10:00:00Z",
    "message_type": "menu_plan",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "payload": { ... },
  "metadata": {
    "confidence_score": 0.95,
    "priority": "high",
    "retry_count": 0
  },
  "signature": {
    "hash": "sha256-...",
    "session_id": "session-..."
  }
}
```

SHA-256 audit hash on every message. Every agent action 
logged with agent_id, action, status, and timestamp.

## Azure Services

| Service | Resource | Role in System |
|---|---|---|
| Azure OpenAI GPT-4o | foundry-jmagno-2026 | Powers all 5 agent reasoning calls |
| Azure AI Search | search-jmagno-2026 | RAG knowledge base — 70 documents (68 recipes + pricing + suppliers) |
| Azure Cosmos DB | cosmos-jmagno-2026 | Order persistence + historical order context queries |
| Azure Blob Storage | storagejmagno2026 | Document storage layer |

---

## Microsoft Agent Framework

Agents are registered as a Semantic Kernel plugin 
(`CateringAgentsPlugin`) and invoked via `kernel.invoke()` 
throughout the pipeline. AutoGen's `RoundRobinGroupChat` drives
the budget negotiation conversation between the Accountant and
Head Chef agents.

**Active — Semantic Kernel:** `CateringAgentsPlugin` with `@kernel_function` 
decorators. Concierge, Head Chef, Accountant, and Logistics Lead are
invoked via `kernel.invoke()`. Stock Manager calls `run_stock_manager()`
directly due to a Semantic Kernel serialization incompatibility with the
parallel invocation pattern — the agent logic, inputs, and outputs are
identical; only the invocation path differs.

**Active — AutoGen GroupChat:** `AccountantAgent` + `HeadChefAgent` run in a
`RoundRobinGroupChat` (≤3 rounds) when the plan exceeds budget.
AutoGen conducts the negotiation conversation; flagged dishes are
passed back to the Semantic Kernel Head Chef for structured revision.
Graceful fallback to manual loop on any AutoGen exception.

**Production roadmap:** SK Planner for adaptive pipeline sequencing,
SK Memory Plugins for persistent agent context

## Integration Test Suite

22/23 integration checks passing across 6 sections
(these are end-to-end smoke tests that validate pipeline 
behavior — dietary enforcement, cost scaling, edge case 
handling — not unit tests of individual computations):

| Section | Result |
|---|---|
| Section 1: Dietary and allergy enforcement | 7/7 ✅ |
| Section 2: Menu variety / non-determinism | 1/1 ✅ |
| Section 3: Special notes handling | 3/3 ✅ |
| Section 4: Bonus features | 5/5 ✅ |
| Section 5: Cost scaling reality check | 1/1 ✅ |
| Section 6: Edge cases | 5/6 ⚠️ (Edge Case 6 timing — Azure free tier latency, logic correct) |

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Azure services configured (see Environment Variables)

### Backend
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
source venv/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt

venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn main:app \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Run Correctness Suite
```bash
venv\Scripts\python.exe -m tests.test_correctness
```

### Deployment Note
System runs locally connecting to Azure backend services 
(OpenAI, Cosmos DB, AI Search). App Service deployment 
blocked by free subscription quota — current setup 
demonstrates full Azure integration with local compute. 
Production deployment target: Azure App Service or 
Azure Container Apps.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Response time** — 20-120s under Azure free tier due
   to multiple GPT-4o calls. Logistics and Stock Manager
   now run in parallel (asyncio.gather), reducing the
   final two stages. Production fix: provisioned throughput.
2. **Knowledge base dishes only** — dishes outside
   recipes.json are substituted with nearest match.
3. **Fixed labor rate** — PHP 150/guest flat rate.
   Production would vary by service style and duration.
4. **Inventory source** — Stock Manager queries Cosmos DB
   (`catering-inventory` container, 33 seeded items) first.
   Falls back to local `data/mock_inventory.json` if Cosmos
   is unavailable. Production would have live inventory writes
   after each procurement list is generated.
5. **Local execution** — App Service blocked by free
   subscription quota. Functionally identical to cloud
   deployment for demo purposes.
6. **Agent progress simulation** — The UI shows live
   elapsed time and time-based agent advancement during
   processing. True per-agent real-time status requires
   an async pipeline (production roadmap).

## Production Roadmap

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Tool Calling | SK `@kernel_function` tools for on-demand RAG (search_recipes, get_price) instead of pre-fetch | High |
| SK Planner | Dynamic pipeline generation — agents register capabilities, Planner decides execution order | Medium |
| Real-Time SSE | FastAPI BackgroundTasks + asyncio.Queue per session — true per-agent progress streaming | Medium |
| Provisioned Throughput | Sub-5s per GPT-4o call — 8-20s total pipeline vs current 20-120s | High |
| Evals Framework | RAGAS/custom harness for prompt quality A/B testing | Low |
| Live Inventory Updates | Subtract purchased quantities from Cosmos inventory after each order | Low |
| Azure App Service | Container deployment when subscription quota allows | Medium |
